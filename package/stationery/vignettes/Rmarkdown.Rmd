This discusses the basics of Rmarkdown that are important for

preparation. In our center, we expect all authors who prepare
documents with Rmarkdown should understand the issues.

# Introduction: Terminology

`Rmarkdown` is a style of markdown document used for preparing guides
and reports about R.  It is not the same as "markdown," for which
there are many different dialects, and will Rmarkdown does not always
follow the same syntax.  The general framework to which it is closest
is `pandoc` markdown because the program `pandoc` is used in several
parts of the document compilation process.


# Document-wide options

In the beginning of a markdown document, there is a header written in
the YAML format (YAML, which originally meant *Yet Another Markup
Language* but its developers now prefer *YAML Ain't Markup Language*). 

The header for the document you are reading now in PDF is:

```

What do we have there? Main sections that begin with keywords `title`,
`author`, `output`, `header-includes`, and `keywords`. The output
spection specifies `pdf_document`, which means that the `Rmarkdown`
file will be converted from `Rmarkdown` to `markdown`, then into
\LaTeX, then PDF.  The `header-includes` section is relevant only to the
\LaTeX stage of document preparation.

#### Observations about YAML

1. The header begins with, in column 1
    
    `---`
    
    and ends with
    
    `---`
2. The format of the YAML header is **VERY** sensitive. Errors in
   formatting are fatal.

    A. Subsections are represented by indentation

    B. Use spaces to intend, NEVER tabs. Use an editor that displays
    in fixed width fonts, so that the number of spaces is apparent.

3. Parameter and value are separated by `:`, a colon, rather than
   equal sign.
4. The backend, either HTML or PDF, is specified here. This choice
   determines the other settings that are allowed.
 
    Beyond the very simple headers, be aware that it is generally NOT
    possible to change from a PDF to HTML backend without making a lot
    of changes in the header. Please be warned that the Rstudio
    pulldown menu that says "Knit to PDF" or "Knit to HTML" is
    deceptive, implying one can easily choose between backends and that the
    document will work well in either output format. This is decidedly
    untrue. Be warned also that Rstudio will revise the content of the
    document header, possibly corrupting its formatting.
5. The package `rmarkdown` provides a function named `render`. This
    function is the orchestrator of the document production process. R
    code chunks are processed (knitted) into the markdown document,
    then it is "compiled" into HTML or PDF.  The `render` function
    allows arguments that can override the YAML header arguments.  They
    generally have the same name.

    For example, the header setting `keep_tex: true`, will be
    overridden by argument `keep_tex=FALSE` given to the render function.


# Preparing an Rmarkdown Document
	
## Use a text editor

An R markdown file is suffixed ".Rmd", *not* ".rmd". It is a "raw
text" file. Don't edit it with MS Word.  Instead, use a programmers
file editor, such as Emacs, Notepad++, or an integrated development
environment, such as Rstudio, to edit the file.

Remember that the markdown philosophy is that a document should look
reasonably nice, even before it is compiled.  That means authors
should take care that their document has reasonably "shaped"
paragraphs. Lines should generally be 80 characters or less.


## Document body has markdown, plus

The body of the Rmarkdown document can include both "markdown" syntax,
which we hope is compatible with either PDF or HTML backends, as well
as a selection of backend-specific code input. In a document with an
HTML backend, authors can write "raw" HTML when they can't find
Rmarkdown syntax that works.

In our experience, it is also *mostly* workable to include \LaTeX\
code in `Rmarkdown` documents. Recall that documents in `Rmarkdown`
are converted from `Rmd` to `md` by the knitting process, and then into
\LaTeX\ by `pandoc`, and then into PDF by a \LaTeX\ compiler
(`pdflatex` or `xetex`). As a result, one can insert quite a bit of
\LaTeX\ code and it will often be successfully post-processed in the
last stage of document compilation.

We have found that some \LaTeX\ code does not work well, however, so
it is not possible at the current time to say "everything
works". However, many things do work.

As in \LaTeX\ itself, when an author wants to add features, it is
generally necessary to add `\usepackage{}` statements in the \LaTeX\
document preamble. Note that, as we insert \LaTeX\ code in this
document, we need to insert \LaTeX\ `\usepackage code` to make the
features available to the compiler. These appear in the YAML header 
like so.

```
header-includes:
-  \usepackage{amsmath}
```

That one was needed when some math expressions were inserted in the
document.  

We use a \LaTeX\ template for this document.  That template creates a
document style and it also can include `\usepackage{}`
statements. Packages that are not included in the template (where we
include packages that we *always* expect to use) are tucked into the
document header.


# Basic Rmarkdown

These are the most frequently used markdown idioms that work well in
both HTML and PDF backends. These things work well in either backend
because they are understood to `pandoc`, which has the job to convert
the `markdown` document into either \LaTeX\ or HTML.

1. Character styling. 
    *  *Italics* result from asterisks (`*italics*`)
    *  **bold face** results from two asterisks (`**boldface**`).
    *  `computer code` should be a typewriter fixed width font produced by
    using two "backticks" ($^\backprime \textrm{computer code} ^\backprime$) 
1. Section headers. 
    *  `#` is level 1 header
    *  `##` is level 2 subheading
    *  levels below are used differently in HTML and PDF.  The ability of
   html documents to include specialized subsections is one of the
   advantages of that backend. In markdown, they provide for 6 levels
   of headings.
1. Paragraph styling
    * Paragraphs are created by blank lines
    * Single-spaced line: Two blank spaces at end of line signify new
    line without creating new paragraph (blank line) below.
    *  Indented material like this:

    >  quotations or other highlighted material (block quotes)

    begins with a $>$ character in column 1, followed by a space:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    > quotations or other highlighted material (block quotes)
    \end{lstlisting}

    * code listings that are not chunks, such as

    ```
    int x = 3
    ```

    are requested by three ticks before and after

    \begin{lstlisting}
    `r ''````
    int x = 3
    `r ''````
    \end{lstlisting}

4. Lists. 
    *  Numbered lists can be created by putting a number in column 1
       of a new line, followed by a space.
    *  Bullet lists can be created by putting an asterix in column 1
       of a new line, followed by a space.
 
    *  Lists can be nested by typing four blank spaces for each level
       of nesting.
    *  Question About lists: how do we insert separate paragraphs
       under list headings and then re-continue the list in Rmarkdown
       ?? ??.

1. Hyperlinks, such as [CRMDA](https://crmda.ku.edu), for which the
   markdown is `[CRMDA](https://crmda.ku.edu)`.
5. Citations. Need to know how to use natbib citations in a markdown
   document ?? ???
	
This *basic markdown* is compatible with either HTML or PDF
output. While I am writing in a document intended for PDF, I can use
\LaTeX\ code `\emph{italicize}` to \emph{italicize}, as you can see,
but I can also use markdown syntax `*italicize*` to *italicize*. If I
were intending this document for HTML, I could insert
`<i>italicize</i>` to reach the same result. Where possible, we should
use the generic syntax rather than backend-specific markup, because
this keeps open the door that we might want to change the backend from
PDF to HTML at some point. Of course, *the key assumption is that the
backend-neutral methods actually work* to get the job done, and that
is simply untrue in my experience. Every document worth presenting
will have at least one backend-specific feature.
	

## Math in Markdown documents

There's a fairly broad range of mathematical markup that will work in
Rmarkdown documents intended for PDF and HTML. So far as we can tell,
documents intended for PDF (which can add \LaTeX\ packages) can
exploit all of the mathematical features, while HTML documents do not
have that same bragging point. There are other weaknesses in the math
tool chaing for HTML documents, to which we shall return.

Here are the highlights.

1. In-line math markup is dollar-sign bracketed, just as in \LaTeX
   itself. We can write `$f_{ij} x_{i} \times y_{j}^2$` for
   $f_{ij} x_{i} \times y_{j}^2$. Using the usual \LaTeX\ format, we
   can write the Greek letters, binary relations, and other important
   symbols. Behold:

\[
   \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \Gamma, \chi, \approx, \ne, \geq, \leq, \pm,
   \sim, \rightarrow, \pi, \textrm{and} \infty.
\]

2. Displayed equations--equations that are centered or otherwise set
apart from the text--can be bracketed by `\[` and `\]`. In \LaTeX,
it is not longer recommended to use the double-dollar sign notation
for displayed equations.
 
Compare the inline mode, $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}$
with the display equation:

\[
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}.
\]

that results from

```
\[
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}.
\]
```

After some testing, it appears that in order to have equations with
numbers (via labels, allowing cross references), the best avenue is to
change the display markup to use `amsmath` equations. In the
following, we use the \LaTeX\ ```\begin{equation}```, which comes from
the \LaTeX\ package *amsmath*.

```
\begin{equation}
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}.
\label{eq:mean}
\end{equation}
```

This equation is numbered, because the label macro is included within
the equation:

\begin{equation}
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}.
\label{eq:mean}
\end{equation}

Because we labeled the equation, we can now use cross references. As
the reader can see in equation (\ref{eq:mean}), the arithmetic mean is
a very lovely formula. If we insert equations before or after that
one, they will be renumbered automatically and cross references will
be adjusted.

Another benefit of introducing the amsmath support is that arrays
can be demonstrated.

\begin{equation}
A_{m,n} = \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
a & b & c\\
d & e & f\\
g & h & i\\
\end{array}\right)
\label{eq:amatrix}
\end{equation}

Given the fact that the `equation` environment provides all of the
needed features, it seems obvious that authors should prefer to use
it, rather than the simpler `\[` markup.

This is not the right place for a comprehensive guide to \LaTeX.
Users will need to install a \LaTeX\ distribution and then a
user-friendly editor that will help create equation markup.  Many
users in the CRMDA lab use LyX, which offers a "View source" feature
to inspect \LaTeX\ coding for equations.	

## Syntax and code chunks

Code chunks are discussed in a separate vignette that is available
with the `stationery` package, "Code Chunks".  Code chunks are allowed in
`Rmarkdown` documents intended for either HTML or PDF.

In `Rmarkdown` documents intended for HTML output, `knitr` is the only
chunk-processing technology that is available.  In `Rmarkdown`
documents, the outer boundaries of a chunk are demarcated by three
back ticks, along with squiggly braces and the letter "r", which
designates the language being processed (`knitr` can handle several
languages).

\begin{lstlisting}
`r ''````{r}
lm(y ~ x, data = dat)
`r ''````
\end{lstlisting}

In contrast, a chunk in a `noweb`/\LaTeX\ document would look like
this:

```
<<>>=
lm(y ~ x, data = dat)
@
```

Options which control chunk management are quite elaborate in `knitr`,
but most authors will find that there are 5 (or so) options that they use
frequently and the others can be discovered in the documentation
when emergencies arise:

1. eval
1. echo
1. include
1. results

These control if the chunk is calculated, displayed, and included in
the output. 

`knitr` has fine grained settings for sizing, saving, and placing
figures. These are discussed in our vignette, "Code Chunks". We expect
that all authors will not have too much difficulty creating chunks
that

1. are not evaluated, but are displayed "beautifully" to the reader.
2. are not displayed, but are evaluated, and the results may (or may
   not) be displayed for the reader.
3. create graphics, which are automatically included in the document.
4. create graphics (or other files) that are not automatically
   included in the document. Graphics are saved in image files that
   can be inserted at a different part in the document
5. import previous chunks for re-analysis.


## Presentable tables

In a report document, it would be unusual to display a large chunk of
R code or output. Instead, reports typically include stylized tables,
graphs, and equations. 

Unfortunately, this is a point at which the backend-neutral document
processing strategies break down. Markdown allows some elementary
tables, but these are unsuitable for statistical tables. Instead, one needs
to create backend-specific tables in order to have something
presentable. 


The very nice table-making routines for R were originally developed
for PDF/\LaTeX\, and alternative backends like HTML were added later.
At the current time, regression tables can be generated in either
\LaTeX\ or HTML by the R package `texreg`, `xtable`, `rockchalk`, and
many others.


### Warnings aside, here are 2 table-making recipes

I have used two approaches to include tables in documents. 

1. The "automatic" method.  Write a code chunk that creates an output table
   that is good enough to go into the report without revision and
   allow the document to use it. The chunk option `results="asis"` is 
   used to signal that the result of the chunk is valid markup that is
   to go directly into the backend document.
1. The "slow lane" method. Write a chunk that creates a table in a
   file on disk. Then one can review and edit the file, and include it
   in the document manually.

In "guides" and less formal documents, I often use the automatic
method (beauty of presentation is not the primary emphasis). In
reports to clients, I often need to use the second method because
tables almost never come out in a perfectly presentable format.

Because I wrote the `outreg` function in the rockchalk a long time
ago, it still holds a special place in my heart. I will use it for a
demonstration. `outreg` works with standard R regressions (`lm`,
`glm`).  Suppose we have data about cancer prevalence (y) and predictors
including exposure to plutonium (x1), vegetables (x2), and tobacco (x3). 

```{r fakedata, include=F}
library(rockchalk)
dat <- genCorrelatedData2(N = 1000, rho = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.7),
                          beta = c(1, 1.0, -1.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0, 0.1), stde = 1)
```

Regressions are estimated. The second regression includes
interactions.

```{r reg10, echo=T, results="hide"}
m1 <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data = dat)
m2 <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2*x3 + x1*x3, data = dat)

```

The variable labels are created as `varLab` and they are supplied in
the call to `outreg`. 

\begin{lstlisting}
`r ''````{r reg20, results="asis"}
varLab <- c(y = "Cancer", x1 = "Plutonium", x2 = "Veggies",
            x3 = "Tobacco", `x2:x3` = "Veg $\\times$ Tob",
            `x1:x3` = "Plut $\\times$ Tob")
or10 <- outreg(list("Cancer OLS" = m1, "Cancer Interaction" = m2), 
               tight=FALSE, varLab = varLab)
`r ''````
\end{lstlisting}

The table is inserted flush left in the document at the point of the
code chunk because I did not create a floating table object in which
to situate it.

```{r reg20, echo=F, results="asis"}
varLab <- c(y = "Cancer", x1 = "Plutonium", x2 = "Veggies",
            x3 = "Tobacco", `x2:x3` = "Veg $\\times$ Tob",
            `x1:x3` = "Plut $\\times$ Tob")
or10 <- outreg(list("Cancer OLS" = m1, "Cancer Interaction" = m2),
               tight=FALSE, varLab = varLab)
```


The other way to do this is to save the table in a file, and then
include it in a document.  I do this in some reports because the
\LaTeX\ (or HTML) tables created by software are never *exactly* right
and I want to fine tune them.

```{r reg30}
cat(or10, file = "tmpout/or10file.tex")
```

The file "or10file.tex" can be edited by hand, and then inserted into
the \LaTeX\ document (for the PDF backend). If I am using this method,
I can insert a floating table with a proper caption and label. See
Table \ref{tab:reg30}, which results from the following.  

```
\begin{table} \caption{Regression Analysis\label{tab:reg30}}
\input{tmpout/or10file.tex} \end{table} 
``` 

\begin{table}
\caption{Regression Analysis\label{tab:reg30}}
\input{tmpout/or10file.tex} 
\end{table}

Admittedly, this two step process to create the floating \LaTeX\ label
is not truly necessary.  The `outreg` function could do that for
us. The same result using the results="asis" chunk:

\begin{lstlisting}
`r ''````{r reg40, results="asis"}
or10 <- outreg(list("Cancer OLS" = m1, "Cancer Interaction" = m2), tight=FALSE,
               varLab = varLab, title = "Regression Analysis asdfasdf",
               label="tab:reg30")
`r ''````
\end{lstlisting}

Because this document is intended for the PDF backend, any \LaTeX\
generating table function should work.  For linear regressions,
multilevel models, and glm fits, I find the `rockchalk::outreg` output
is fine, but other kinds of models often arrive with custom
table-making routines. I have not found a single approach that works
beautifully for all kinds of regressions, and I expect other authors
will say the same thing because new packages to create \LaTeX\ tables
seem to crop up in the R repositories on a monthly basis. It is worth
mentioning that some of the \LaTeX\ table generators, like `texreg`,
allow the use of `bookman` markup to beautify the placement of
horizontal lines, so the document preamble must be modified to include
that package.

I often need to include simpler tabular material in documents and I
always try to use the package `xtable`. `xtable` is not the simplest
package, but it has been around longer than the others and it has more
detailed features than any other package. In particular, the
`longtable` class, which allows tables that gracefully split over
"page breaks", is available. If I cannot get the result I want with
`xtable`, the second approach I try is the `latex` function in the
`Hmisc` package. There are plenty of other table-making R packages,
but my opinion is that if one can master `xtable`, then one can
generate just about any kind of table.

## Warnings, cautions and other hysterical statements

Rmarkdown is similar to, but the exactly
the same, as the
[general markdown specification](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown).
It is different from other specialized dialects, such as
the [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm) and
other variants. Be cautious about using style guides that are not
intended explicitly for Rmarkdown documents. There is a good chance
their advice is irrelevant. Google searches will sometimes lead to the
wrong answer for a particular form of Markdown.

Another major concern is that illegal \LaTeX\ code in documents
intended for HTML will be ignored in the document production process.
The document compiles without error, but HTML result is
incomplete. Where we expect to see math, there is *empty nothing*.  By
itself, this problem seems serious enough to make me think the HTML
backend should not be used. The `markdown` $\rightarrow$ HTML conversion is the
weak spot. The `markdown` $\rightarrow$ PDF transition is not similarly
flawed. It halts with error messages.  The conclusion from all of this
is the following: 

> *Authors must exert themselves to proofread the
> HTML output to make sure it appears as intended.*

Another problem we have discovered is that even valid HTML markup can
sometimes be corrupted by `pandoc`. Valid HTML (and PDF, for that
matter) can include empty spaces that are inserted by authors to make
their markup easier to read.  The spaces are confusing to `pandoc`,
which may interpret them as markdown formatting statements (markdown
uses spaces to indicate nesting of lists or code sections.  At the
current time, it appears to be necessary to process all HTML markup
that goes into the markdown document to remove spaces in the beginning
of lines.

In our experimentation with Rmarkdown, we have noticed another quirk.  I
document intended for PDF, one writes `\LaTeX` to produce \LaTeX. On
the other, in a document intended for HTML, writing `\LaTeX` produces
one of those empty spaces previously mentioned.  Instead, in the
document intended for HTML one must insert `$\LaTeX$`, as if this were
a valid mathematical expression, which it is not. Inserting `$\LaTeX$`
in Rmarkdown intended for PDF results in an error message:

\begin{lstlisting}
! You can't use `\spacefactor' in math mode.
\@->\spacefactor
                 \@m {}
l.934 ...to compile and the error message \(\LaTeX

pandoc: Error producing PDF
\end{lstlisting}

Finally, there is a fundamental weakness of HTML documents. Math is
not "in" the HTML file. Instead, there is javascript code that is
shown in the Web browser using a framework called MathJax. MathJax
allows inclusion of math markup in the page which--when the conditions
are right--can be converted by the Web browser to look like equations.
The MathJax display system works better and better over time; it
*almost always works*. The Web browser must be able to retrieve files
from the MathJax server in order to display the document.
If the reader is offline, or the MathJax server fails. Users will see
markup, rather than equations, when the network fails.

# # Bibliographical citation test is appropriate. 

The leaders in the field [@diggle_analysis_2013] are sure that I'm
correct about most everything.  Diggle and colleagues
[-@diggle_analysis_2013, 37] also seem confident that they did not
agree to the preceeding. Note that to get the full parenthesized 
statement with names and dates, we insert hard brackets `[`,
an `@` sign, the bibtex tag, and acloser `]`. If we don't want
their names, we insert a `-` sign. It is also possible to
refer to a group of projects [@hsiao_analysis_2014;
@fitzmaurice_applied_2011; @mccullagh_nelder_1983].

It is a little bit frustrating that the Rmarkdown idea requires the
references to be in the very last header of the document. I would
rather place them myself, where I want them. They want us to insert

```
# References
``` 

to get automatic placement. The very bad thing I notice is that even
if you put that in the second-to-last header, the citations will
appear at the very last part of the document, but the word
`References` will appear where you put it.

The style of the bibliography will not match what we generally
want. Is close, the Chicago author-year format. We need a "CSL" file
to alter the style of the output. See 
[authoring_bibliographies_and_citations](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html).

Unfortunately, it appears this is difficult to get the references in
the way we want them in PDF output. This is another reason that I
think we should use LaTeX documents rather than Markdown when we
intend to output PDF.




# Conclusion

For the sake of clarity, then, I state the following:

> If the backend in PDF, one should should use functions that
> provide tables using \LaTeX\ code.

On the other hand, 

> if the backend is HTML, then functions that create HTML markup code
> should be used.
