# This document was too huge to include in the package

We have run into a lot of trouble while working with R markdown.

After customizing and creating a template, we finally noticed that all
of our documents are GIGANTIC. The compiled HTML documents are too
large for inclusion in the R package.  The heartbreak in this is
that the only reason a person would prefer to author for HTML output
is to take advantage of the special features that HTML allows.  

We moved the vignette Rmd file into a the package folder
rmarkdown/templates/rmd2html-guide. The markdown file discussing about
some benefits and problems with R markdown is called
HTML_special_features.Rmd.  That is included in the package, it can be
compiled. It explains how it can be compiled. But we cannot provide
the compiled copy.

Since that is too huge to distribute with the package, we are
going to host it on a CRMDA website. [HTML Special
Features](http://crmda.dept.ku.edu/guides/48.stationery_for_R/vignettes/HTML_special_features.html).

There are Wiki posts about ways to reduce the size of R-markdown 
produced documents, but, sadly, it seems that using those methods
eliminates the special features that are attractive about HTML.


# Session Info

```{r sessionInfo, echo = FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```


```{r warnings, echo = FALSE}
if(!is.null(warnings())) {
    print("Warnings:")
    warnings()
}
```
