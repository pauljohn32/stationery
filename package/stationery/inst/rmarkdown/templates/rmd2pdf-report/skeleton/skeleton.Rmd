# Introduction {-}

## Make minimal changes to the top part. {-}

Fill in your name, title, email, tags.  

# Your sections here {-}

Please do use sections and subsections wish brief titles
that are well crafted to guide the reader's eye.

One equation to test

\[
\Sigma_{gt}=\Lambda_{gt}\Psi_{gt}\Lambda'_{gt}+\Theta_{gt}
\]

# `R` Code Chunks {-}

In Reports, raw code chunks displaying input are not generally shown.
Instead, generate valid \LaTeX output or graphic images and include
them. 

If a LaTeX table file has been created from another document,
we do not recommend "cutting and pasting" into this document.
Instead, use "\textbackslash{}input{filename}". 


# Session Info {-}

Session Information is usually not written into a report, but an output file is created by the following pieces.

```{r session, include=F}
zz <- gsub("Rmd", "Rout", knitr::current_input())
capture.output(sessionInfo(), file = zz, append = FALSE)
if (!is.null(warnings())){
    capture.output(warnings(), file = zz, append = TRUE)
}
```

```{r session20, include=F}
## Don't delete this. It puts the interactive session options
## back the way they were. If this is compiled within a session
## it is vital to do this.
options(opts.orig)
```
