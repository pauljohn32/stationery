# Header Level 1 with a number

# Header Level 1 without number {-}

If you DO NOT want section numbers, insert {-} to prevent the 
compiler from inserting them.

## Make minimal changes to the top part. {-}

Fill in your name, title, email, tags.  Please don't change the
pdf_document settings unless you know what you are doing.




[//]: (All guides must have this as the final stanza)

# Session Info {-}

Session Information is usually not written into a report, but in a
guide file we regularly will include it as follows.

```{r sessionInfo, echo=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```

```{r warnings, echo=FALSE}
if(!is.null(warnings())){
    print("Warnings:")
    warnings()
}
```

```{r RoptionsRestore, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
## Don't delete this. It puts the interactive session options
## back the way they were. If this is compiled within a session
## it is vital to do this.
options(opts.orig)
par(par.orig)
```
