abstract: Author, please REMEMBER TO INCLUDE AN ABSTRACT BEFORE
    FINALIZING THIS DOCUMENT! For example - This instruction describes
    several key features/functionalities of R Markdown for producing
    colorful and vivid HTML format Guide documents. The demonstrations
    include embedding R code into an .Rmd file, inserting
    mathematical expressions (equations and matrices), and displaying
    R output and graphs/images. A careful study of this document will
    help learners to gain a basic understanding of the rmd2html
    workflow, especially when using it to create CRMDA Guide
    documents.

# How to Compile the Document

Run the render script with this document, you'll see what we mean -
   please open a terminal, navigate to the working directory of the .Rmd file, and run:

```
./rmd2html.sh guide-instructions.Rmd
```

The rendered output (an HTML) file can be opened using Firefox or Chrome/Chromium.

# General Features


## Math via $\LaTeX$ markup

$\LaTeX$ markup can be used to typset beautiful equations with great flexability. Some examples follow. 

We can create a matrix formula like so:

$$
A_{m,n} =
 \begin{pmatrix}
  a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \cdots & a_{1,n} \\
  a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \cdots & a_{2,n} \\
  \vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
  a_{m,1} & a_{m,2} & \cdots & a_{m,n}
 \end{pmatrix}
$$

This example uses the alternative display math $\[$, and a different
type of matrix. The double dollar-sign is same as begin equation.


\begin{equation}
A_{m,n} = \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
a & b & c\\
d & e & f\\
g & h & i\\
\end{array}\right)
\label{eq:another1}
\end{equation}


After some testing, it appears also that many $\LaTeX$ symbols that we
would expect to use have no benefit in Rmd documents.

We don't know if there is a comprehensive list of which $\LaTeX$ math
symbols are allowed, but we wish somebody would find one.

The Bayes' theorem

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

The binomial probability:

$$
f(y|N,p) = \frac{N!}{y!(N-y)!}\cdot p^y \cdot (1-p)^{N-y} = {{N}\choose{y}} \cdot p^y \cdot (1-p)^{N-y}
$$

To calculate the **mean** of \textit{n} observations of variable \textit{x}, you can use:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}
$$

Note that this equation looks quite nice above where it's in display math mode. It is more compact but not quite as nice looking if we present it using inline mode, e.g., $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}$.

Let's do the same with the equation for **variance**. First the inline version, which is
$\sigma^{2} = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \left(x_{i} - \bar{x}\right)^{2}} {n-1}$. And then the display mode version:
$$\sigma^{2} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}
  \left(x_{i} - \bar{x}\right)^{2}}
  {n-1}$$

And, finally, we'll end with the **standard deviation**. Here's the inline version, $\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \left(x_{i} - \bar{x}\right)^{2}} {n-1}}$. And here's the display version.
$$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \left(x_{i} - \bar{x}\right)^{2}} {n-1}}$$

There are helpful online editors - [like this one](http://mathstat.uohyd.ernet.in/equationeditor/equationeditor.php)

	 
### Equations can be written in LaTeX, either "inline" or "display" mode.

Equations can be introduced in the style of LaTeX. If the document
is processed into a PDF file, the LaTeX programs will be used, but
if the document is rendered to HTML, then symbolic questions are positioned
into the output and then the MathJax javascript framework is used to
display the math in the browser.

Typing the markup is like writing in LaTeX. Two dollar signs ($\$$)
surround an inline mathematical expression while a display equation
(centered and separated) is bracketed by two dollar signs ($\$\$$).
The two dollar signs are often written on a line by themselves
for visual separation. We note that other methods that are used to
initiate display equations in latex also work, including $\[$ or
$\begin{equation}$.

\textbackslash{}begin\{equation\} and \textbackslash{}end\{equation\}
and \textbackslash{}[ and \textbackslash{}] generate the same. We need
to know if there is a recommended style.

Fractions (\\frac{}{}): $\frac{2}{3}$.

Hats (\\hat{}): $\hat{\lambda}=1.02$.

Square Root (\\sqrt{}): $\sqrt{4}=2$.

Some Greek letters
$$\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \Gamma$$


Some popular binary operators are

$$ + - = \approx \ne \ge \lt \pm $$
$$ \pi \approx 3.1415927 $$
$$ a_i \ge 0~~~\forall i $$
$$ x \lt 15 $$

###Equation Numbering

Sometimes you may want to designate numbered equations. Unfortunately, markdown to HTML does not support auto-numbering equations by default. However, you can designate static equation numbers by adding```\tag{}``` to the end of your equations, like so:


$$ + - = \approx \ne \ge \lt \pm\tag{1} $$
$$ \pi \approx 3.1415927\tag{2} $$
$$ a_i \ge 0~~~\forall i\tag{3} $$
$$ x \lt 15\tag{4} $$


##Knit (incorporate R chunks, and output)

R code chunks can be incorperated into documents, this allows for the full functionality of the R programming environment to be "knitted" into a markdown report. Code chunks have many options which can be aplied to change the functionality of a specific chunk. The following link presents a well organized list of some potential chunk options.

https://yihui.name/knitr/options/

###Plots

Plots or figures can be added to any Markdown document through the use of R code chunks. 

```{r myFirstPlot, dev=c('png','pdf'), fig.keep='all'}
hist(rnorm(500))
```

```{r}
x <- rnorm(1000)
print(x[1:20])
```

```{r mySecondPlot, dev=c('png','pdf'), fig.keep='all'}
hist(rnorm(20))
```

###Graphics & Figures

We can use mapping for geographically oriented information.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(maps)
par(mar=rep(0, 4))
map("nz", fill=TRUE, col="grey80")
points(174.75, -36.87, pch=16, cex=2)
arrows(172, -36.87, 174, -36.87, lwd=3)
text(172, -36.87, "Auckland  ", adj=1, cex=.9)

maplocs <- map(projection="sp_mercator", wrap=TRUE, lwd=0.1, 
               col="dodgerblue", ylim=c(-60, 75),
               interior=FALSE, orientation=c(90, 180, 0), add=TRUE,
               plot=FALSE)
xrange <- range(maplocs$x, na.rm=TRUE)
yrange <- range(maplocs$y, na.rm=TRUE)
aspect <- abs(diff(yrange))/abs(diff(xrange))
# customised to 6.5 by 4.5 figure size
par(fig=c(0.99 - 0.5, 0.99, 0.01, 0.01 + 0.5*aspect*4.5/6.5), 
    mar=rep(0, 4), new=TRUE)
plot.new()
plot.window(xlim=xrange,
            ylim=yrange)
map(projection="sp_mercator", wrap=TRUE, lwd=0.1, ylim=c(-60, 75),
    interior=FALSE, orientation=c(90, 180, 0), add=TRUE)
symbols(-.13, -0.8, circles=1, inches=0.1, add=TRUE)
```

Sometimes a figure expresses more than words. Figures can also be included in R markdown documents.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning =FALSE}
par(xaxs="i", yaxs="i", xpd=FALSE)
    plot(c(0, 1), c(0, 1), type="n", ann=FALSE, axes=FALSE)
    box("figure")
    rect(0, 0, 1, 1, col="light grey", border="grey")
    axis(1, at=c(0, 1), c("", ""))
    mtext("Min x", side=1, adj=0, line=1)
    mtext("Max x", side=1, adj=1, line=1)
    axis(2, at=c(0, 1), c("", ""))
    mtext("Min y", side=2, adj=0, line=1)
    mtext("Max y", side=2, adj=1, line=1)
    lines(c(.6, .6, 0), c(0, .6, .6), lty="dashed")
    text(.6, .6, expression(paste("The location ", 
            group("(",list(x[i], y[i]),")"))), pos=3)
    points(.6, .6, pch=16)
    axis(1, at=.6, "")
    mtext(expression(x[i]), side=1, at=.6, line=.7)
    axis(2, at=.6, "")
    mtext(expression(y[i]), side=2, at=.6, line=.7)
        
```



### Tables

Here is an example of the rockchalk packages model comparison table

```{r, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, message= FALSE,include=FALSE}
library(rockchalk)
   set.seed(2134234)
   dat <- data.frame(x1 = rnorm(100), x2 = rnorm(100))
   dat$y1 <- 30 + 5 * rnorm(100) + 3 * dat$x1 + 4 * dat$x2
   dat$y2 <- rnorm(100) + 5 * dat$x2
   m1 <- lm(y1 ~ x1, data = dat)
   m2 <- lm(y1 ~ x2, data = dat)
   m3 <- lm(y1 ~ x1 + x2, data = dat)
   gm1 <- glm(y1 ~ x1, family = Gamma, data = dat)

or1 <- outreg(list("Amod" = m1, "Bmod" = m2, "Gmod" = m3),
title = "My Three Linear Regressions", float = FALSE, type = "html",
browse = FALSE)
or1 <- gsub("&nbsp;"," ", or1)
or1 <- gsub("^\\ *", "", or1)
or1 <- paste(or1, collapse = "")
or1 <- gsub("\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ ", " ", or1)
or1 <- gsub("\\ \\ \\ ", " ", or1)
```

```{r,results="asis"}
cat(or1)
```

We have settled on Xtable as a great table producing package which offers flexability and functionality.

```{r, results="asis"}
    library(xtable)
    or2 <- xtable(summary(m1))
    print(or2, type="html")
```

```{r, results="asis"}
    library(psych)
print(xtable(describe(dat)),type = "html")
    
```

# Special Features for Rmd into HTML documents.

HTML documents allow for interactivity as compared to other forms of markdown output. Below are some unique features we take advantage of in HTML output.


## Collored Callouts

Callouts allow the user to specify code chunks, tables, plots, or paragraphs to be collored. This is a great way to get your readers attention. These are always preceded by four # signs. Yes, ####. We stole this idea from other
styles and put them into ours. See usage of {.bs-callout.bs-callout-whatever_you_put here}, where whatever_you_put_here iseither "gray", "red", "orange", "blue", or "green".
   
```{r, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
bscols <- data.frame(old = c("info", "warning", "danger"),
                     new = c("blue", "orange", "red"))
```

### Demonstrating Callouts

#### Gray Callout {.bs-callout .bs-callout-gray}
Content here: Gray for wisdom

#### Red Callout {.bs-callout .bs-callout-red}
Red for warnings

#### Orange Callout {.bs-callout .bs-callout-orange}
Orange for examples

#### Blue Callout {.bs-callout .bs-callout-blue}
Blue for right answers

#### Green Callout {.bs-callout .bs-callout-green}
Green for future directions


#### R code inside a callout {.bs-callout .bs-callout-red}
```{r xsummary}
summary(x)
```
	  


## Interactive Tabs

If you'd like, you can include interactive tabs to HTML reports. Maybe you want to show two similar versions of the same analysis. Or maybe something else. Whatever it may be, be sure to include `{.tabset .tabset-fade}` along with a level 2 header (##). For each tab, put the information under the level 3 header (###). Use another level 2 header to get out of the tabs mode.

The only way (that we know of) to get colors is to wrap the tab headers in a `<span style>` as shown below. This might be useful to draw attention to the tabs. Blue is the default color.
#### What tabs look like {.bs-callout .bs-callout-blue}

```
## You have the ability to include tabs {.tabset .tabset-fade}

If you'd like, you can include different tabs. Maybe you want to show
two similar versions of the same analysis. Or maybe something
else. Whatever it may be, be sure to include `{.tabset .tabset-fade}`
along with a level 2 header (##). For each tab, put the information
under the level 3 header (###). Use another level 2 header to get out
of the tabs mode.

The only way (that we know of) to get colors is to wrap the tab
headers in a `<span style>` as shown below. This might be useful to
draw attention to the tabs. Blue is the default color.

### <span style="color:red">First Tab Here</span>

Some information you'd like to show.

### <span style="color:orange">Second Tab Here</span>

Some more information you'd like to show.

Some more information you'd like to show.

### Third Tab Here

Some final information you'd like to show.

Some final information you'd like to show.

## {.tabset .tabset-fade}

### <span style="color:red">First Tab Here</span>

# Policies about writing in these documents. {.bs-callout .bs-callout-red}

1. Use these callouts to attract attention.

2. Blank rows separate paragraphs.

3. The character width of rows should be 80 or less. I have no idea
how anybody thinks they have a right to impose an infinitely long row,
but it's bad. Edit the document with Emacs, run M-q to get
re-positioned text. If your editor cannot do that, quit using it.

4. Must make sure compiling using the kutils.css located in the crmda
package. For example, `crmda::rmd2html("filename.Rmd")`


[//]: (All guides must have this as the final stanza)

```{r sessionInfo, echo = FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```
