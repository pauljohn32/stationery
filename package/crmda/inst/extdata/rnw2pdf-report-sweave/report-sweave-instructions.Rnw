This is a LaTeX ``noweb'' report generated with the Sweave engine.
We compare it to the very similar document produced with ``knitr''

\section*{Sweave the chunks}

The syntax for chunks in Sweave is like this. 
\begin{lyxcode}
<\textcompwordmark{}<chunkname,~fig=T,~eval=T,~include=F,~echo=T>\textcompwordmark{}>=

\#~R~code~here

@

\section{LyX user Caution}

\textbf{CAUTION}: This template document has some special features
in the preamble. Most importantly, it has margins that are set. The
LyX graphical menu (Document -> Settings -> margins) will break these
defaults. So don't change the page margins or the pagestyle. Other
than that, I don't know of any settings that are fatal.
\begin{lyxcode}
\end{lyxcode}

\subsubsection*{One document-weaving tip: save something for later.}

In the usual ``weave'' documentation, a user is told to type in
a chunk and then the output plops into the document ``right there''.
I don't use that so often anymore, instead what I do very often is
a trick I learned from Duncan Murdoch in the r-help email list. 

Make sure that the document options are set with \code{split=T}.
This works in Sweave or knitr documents. This causes each chunk's
input and output to be saved to a separate file. This includes graphs
and tables. So when I run a function that generates a graph, I get
a pdf output file in the \code{tmpout} folder. 

If I make a figure, the chunk will look like this
\begin{lyxcode}
$<<$chunkfig, include=F, echo=F, fig=T$>>=$

\# R code for figure here

 @
\end{lyxcode}
A file named ``\code{tmpout/t-chunkfig.pdf}'' will be created in
the \code{tmpout} directory. The ``\code{t-}'' at the front of
the file name is inserted because in the document setup, I chose the
global prefix for output files as ``t-''. (Because documents can
have different prefixes, it is possible then to have several R programs
that output files into the same output folder. But I rarely do that
because I don't want to get too confused about what file came from
which program.) To insert that graphic in the document, I will write
a LaTeX statement
\begin{lyxcode}
\textbackslash{}includegraphics{[}width=5in{]}\{tmpout/t-chunkfig\}
\end{lyxcode}
Note I don't put ``.pdf'' on the end of the file name, LaTeX finds
the file named ``t-chunkfig.pdf''. I could use the LyX pull down
Insert -> Graphics as well.

If the code makes a LaTeX table, I'll have this instead
\begin{lyxcode}
$<<$chunktable, include=F, results=tex$>>=$

\# R code here

@
\end{lyxcode}
That creates a file named ``tmpout/t-chunktable.tex''. 
\begin{lyxcode}
\textbackslash{}input\{tmpout/t-chunktable.tex\}

\end{lyxcode}
Why do this? Why separate chunk output creation from inclusion in
a document? The simple answer is that I might want to use that chunk
in a different document. If I save a copy in the separate folder,
then it is very convenient to come along later and make a separate
slide show document displaying the same tables and/or figures.

The automatic ``stick this output in where the chunk is placed''
approach works great with lecture notes and guides because these things
are easy to update and re-run.

I do not find the automatic insertion quite so helpful in the preparation
of reports. Here is the main issue. The ``automatic'' ``self-documenting''
report is almost never exactly correct. It requires some ``finger
painting''. Perhaps that would not be true in the perfect world,
if we were perfect programmers, but I don't live in a perfect world.
In that case, I am willing to settle for a very good second best alternative.
I have learned to export result files from R which can be included
in documents easily, so the documents are easily updated and revised.
They may not be completely automatic because I leave open the possibility
that I might need to adjust a figure's size or a part of a table's
markup.

\section*{Guides versus Reports}

What is the difference between a guide and a report? Simply put, a
report document does not reveal source code and it should not distract
the reader with code or ``raw'' program output. A report document
might just as well be typed by hand, if we could be sure all the numbers
would be typed correctly and they could easily revised. 

<<m1, include=F>>=
dat <- data.frame(x = rnorm(100), y = rnorm(100))
m1 <- lm(y ~ x, data = dat)
summary(m1)
@

In a report, we do not usually have R output in the raw form, or even
in the beautified form from Sweavel or some other ``fancy'' table
formatting framework:

\input{tmpout/t-m1.tex}

The knitr settings we prefer also use the LaTeX listings class to
beautify these chunk outputs, but we hav found that controlling the
style can be more difficult. The preambles of our LaTeX documents
have fairly elaborate configurations for the \code{listings} displays.

In a report, we do not want R code or output, we want a professional-looking
table. 

\subsection*{Listings, not Verbatim}

The Sweave default system uses the LaTeX Verbatim class to offer input
and output chunks in the document. A better approach, pioneered by
Frank Harrell (Vanderbilt) uses the LaTeX class listings. Harrell
prepared a replacement for R's Sweave.sty and called it Sweavel.sty.

We are using the listings class to display input and output chunks
in this document. In the preamble, we have some special settings that
control the color of text, the background, and so forth. The listings
class has an elaborate settings framework. 

At one time, I had difficulty in generating visually appealing listings
output that would match the color \& style of R chunk output from
Sweavel. The problem is solved, as we see now. The following is a
listings display. It is not Sweaved, it is simply a LaTeX listings
environment colored by the settings in the preamble

\begin{lstlisting}
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rpois(100, lambda = 2)
plot(y ~ x)
\end{lstlisting}

The following code chunk in R appears to be the same. 

<<listingcompare, eval=F,echo=T>>=
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rpois(100, lambda = 2)
plot(y ~ x)
@

Those match very closely. At the moment, the same is not true in knitr
documents, we are trying to work that out.

\section*{Make Nice Looking Tables}

In the preparation of a report, we then need to do some work to find
a high quality table-manufacturing function. We don't want to see
an R summary (ugly as it is):

<<Rsummary, echo=F>>=
summary(dat)
@

In R, there are many (many!) packages and functions that can be used
to generate acceptable LaTeX output. The bewildering diversity of
these things is a problem. I became interested in this in 2002 or
2003, and later developed an R function called \code{outreg} that
is now in the \code{rockchalk} R package. There are a host of other
packages that are intended to either 1) manufacture a specific kind
of table (regression tables) or 2) manufacture a reasonable LaTeX
table from a rectangular data object that is generated with R functions
like table.

\subsection*{Summary statistics tables}

We don't have a great summary stats table maker now, but if I were
doing one, I'd probably start with the rockchalk::summarize function
and beautify that. 

\subsubsection*{xtable}

It is easy enough to use the \code{xtable} package to get this done.
Here's an xtable that displays most of the rows in the output from
\code{rockchalk::summarizeNumerics}:

<<tab1, echo=F, results=tex>>=
tab1 <- rockchalk::summarizeNumerics(dat)
tab1.x <- xtable::xtable(tab1[c(1:7,9,10,12) , ])
print(tab1.x, floating = FALSE)
@

The first five rows\textendash the quantiles\textendash may not be
necessary, so we can omit them:

<<tab2, echo=F,results=tex>>=
tab2.x <- xtable::xtable(tab1[c(6:7,9,10,12) , ])
print(tab2.x, floating = FALSE)
@

It may be that people want the output rotated, so that the variable
names are on the rows and the summary stats are in the columns. That's
possible:

<<tab3, echo=F,results=tex>>=
tab3.x <- xtable::xtable(t(tab1[c(6:7,9,10,12) , ]))
print(tab3.x, floating = FALSE)
@

Row names and column names need to be beautified, that's for sure.
I suppose the point here is not that I can throw together an adequate
table in 10 minutes. But rather that if we are making a report, we
need some kind of good looking table. 

One quirk in the \code{xtable} package is that the \code{xtable}
function itself creates a object to hold material for a table, but
the hard work is done by the method \code{print.xtable}, which has
a ton of arguments and details to consider. The hyper-elaborate nature
of the arguments is off-putting, even for a patient person. I expect
that if we made automatic table generation a full time job for a few
of the GRAs, we'd get to the bottom of all of those arguments.

\subsubsection*{knitr::kable}

I used \code{xtable} for the first example. xtable is, so far as
I know, the oldest package for that purpose. 

Today, there are plenty of other functions available. The following
is a result from \code{kable} in the \code{knitr} package:

<<tab4, echo=F,results=tex>>=
tab4.x <- knitr::kable(t(tab1[c(6:7,9,10,12) , ]), format = "latex")
cat(tab4.x)
@

Like \code{xtable}, the \code{kable} function can be used to generate
tables that are headed for LaTeX or HTML documents.

One of the interesting design decisions in creating a table-making
function is whether we ought to enclose the tabular object within
a ``floating'' automatically numbered table. A floating table would
be expected in a LaTeX document.

The \code{kable} function makes the same decision that I made in
\code{outreg}, which is that if the user specifies a title for the
table, then it must mean that the user wants to have the table set
as a floating object. The same code that made the previous table is
changed just slightly to produce a floating object (Look around in
this document for a table named ``In \code{kable}, I added the caption
argument and got this unexpected float''. I found this frustrating
because the \code{kable} function does not include documentation
for insertion of a label that can be used for cross referencing.

<<tab5, echo=F,results=tex>>=
tab5.x <- knitr::kable(t(tab1[c(6:7,9,10,12) , ]), format = "latex", caption = "In kable, I added the caption argument and got this unexpected float")
cat(tab5.x)
@

I'd rather not have kable insert the table float for me, I'd rather
do it manually, as we can see in Table \ref{tab:kable-output}

\begin{table}

\caption{kable output in a float I created manually\label{tab:kable-output}}

\input{tmpout/t-tab4.tex}

\end{table}


\subsection*{Regression output}

I'll illustrate output from the \code{outreg} function in the \code{rockchalk}
package.

This table may not be perfect by APA standards, but it is certainly
good enough for our reports. If we drop this output into the text,
without inserting it into a float, we obtain the following

<<outreg1, echo=F, results=tex>>=
library(rockchalk)
vl <- c("x" = "Excellent Predictor")
outreg(list("First Model" = m1), varLabels = vl, tight = FALSE)
@

One of the truly important differences between Sweave chunks and knitr
chunks is the ``results'' argument. For Sweave, we need ``results='tex'''
but for knitr they changed this to ``results='asis'''.

It is possible to specify a table title and generate a floating object
from outreg, but I don't usually do that. I usually have the argument
float = FALSE because I want to create the floating object myself
and place it where I like. That is illustrated in Table \ref{tab:A-Regression}.

\begin{table}
\caption{A Regression from \protect\code{outreg}\label{tab:A-Regression}}

\input{tmpout/t-outreg1.tex}
\end{table}

There are many other regression-table-making functions available today.
I made some lecture notes about it for the R summer workshops that
we offer at KU (\url{http://pj.freefaculty.org/guides/Rcourse/regression-tables-1}). 

\subsubsection*{Structural equation models}

In the good looking table department, we also need to display structural
equation models. This is a partly solved problem. This has been a
long term objective in CRMDA. 

In the \code{kutils} package, we made a function \code{cfaTable}
that is intended to help. Please see Table \ref{tab:A-Confirmatory-Factor}.
In the preamble of this document, I have some boilerplate code that
causes content in floating tables and figures to be centered automatically.
This looks nice!

<<include=F>>=
library(kutils)
require(lavaan)
@

<<cfa1, echo=F, include=F,results=tex>>=
HS.model <- 'visual  =~ x1 + x2 + x3
textual =~ x4 + x5 + x6
speed   =~ x7 + x8 + x9'
output1 <- cfa(HS.model, data = HolzingerSwineford1939, std.lv = TRUE)
cfa1 <- cfaTable(output1, fit = "rmsea", standardized = TRUE, params = c("loadings", "latentvariances"), type = "latex")
cat(cfa1)
@

\begin{table}

\caption{A Confirmatory Factor Analysis Table\label{tab:A-Confirmatory-Factor}}

\input{tmpout/t-cfa1.tex}

\end{table}

<<RoptionsRestore, echo=F, include=F>>=
## Don't delete this. It puts the interactive session options
## back the way they were. If this is compiled within a session
## it is vital to do this.
options(opts.orig)
par(par.orig)
@
