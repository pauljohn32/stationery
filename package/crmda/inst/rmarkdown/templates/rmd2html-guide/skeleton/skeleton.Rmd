# About this framework

See the `crmda` vignette in the `crmda` package.  That
explains the big picture. 

In the theme folder provided with this document, there is a
copy of the boilerplate file that determines the appearance of the
output. 



## To compile

There are 2 options. Either use the R function

```
crmda::rmd2html("skeleton.Rmd")
```

or the shell script that is provided with the `skeleton.Rmd` file:

```
$ ./rmd2html.sh skeleton.Rmd
```

The compiler is going to ignore many of the settings in your
yaml header because we are using a document template. If you want
to regulate these things (see `?rmd2html`), insert arguments


```
crmda::rmd2html("skeleton.Rmd", toc = TRUE, toc_depth = 1, keep_md = TRUE)
```

The command line script allows the same arguments, however THERE MUST
NOT BE SPACES betwen the option name, the equal sign, and the value of 
the option:

```
$ ./rmd2html.sh --toc=TRUE --toc_depth=1 keep_md=TRUE skeleton.Rmd
```

A full list of arguments is provided in `?rmd2html`.


# Top Level Heading

## Second Level Heading

#### Colored callout is a level 4 heading with markup {.bs-callout .bs-callout-gray}
This is a gray callout. Could be "red", "orange" "blue", "green"
instead of gray. For more on this, there is the vignette "HTML_special_features".

#### Policies about writing in these documents. {.bs-callout .bs-callout-red}
This demonstrates a red callout

## Tabbed sub-sections {.tabset .tabset-fade}

Declare a level 2 heading with `{.tabset .tabset-fade}` and then the
level 3 headers after that are treated as tabs.

One thing on my TODO list is is to make the tab markers more vivid. I
suspect some readers do not realize these are clickable tabs because
they are somewhat subtle.

### <span style="color:red">First Tab Here</span>

Info within first tab. You must click "Second Tab Here" to see the
second tab.

### <span style="color:orange">Second Tab Here</span>

Now you see contents of second tab. I could, literally, write a book
in here. Could be code chunks, pictures, my favorite Bible verses.

### Third Tab Here

Third tab. 

## Equations

Markdown accepts much LaTeX code. Especially well supported are
equations, either "inline", such as $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x1_i +
\varepsilon_i$, or "display" mode.

Because HTML output lacks some features we are accustomed to in \LaTeX
documents, the "usual rules" are not entirely correct. Nevertheless,
we ask authors to limit themselves to two styles of display equations.
Either use the demarcators `\[` and `\]` to declare a display equation:

\[
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x1_i + \varepsilon_i \label{eq:lin10}
\]

Or replace those demarcators with `\begin{equation}` and
`\end{equation}`. Even if the Rmd to HTML translation will tolerate
`$$` and `$$` to frame a displayed equation, don't use them.

Equation numbering does not work as usual in HTML output, that's
a problem discussed in "HTML_special_features".


## Chunks

R code chunks are demarcated by three back-ticks and appear in-text
with a shaded box (because we are using the listings-style output).

```{r myFirstPlot, dev=c('png','pdf')}
x <- rnorm(500)
hist(x)
```

There are many more examples of code chunks in the vignette "code_chunks". 

#### R code inside a colored callout {.bs-callout .bs-callout-red}
```{r xsummary}
mean(x)
```



[//]: (All guides must have this as the final stanza)

## R Session Info
```{r sessionInfo, echo = FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```

```{r warnings, echo = FALSE}
if(!is.null(warnings())){
    print("Warnings:")
    warnings()
}
```
