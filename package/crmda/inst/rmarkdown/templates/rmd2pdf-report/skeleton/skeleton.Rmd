# Nuts and Bolts {-}

## Make minimal changes to the top part. {-}

Fill in your name, title, email, tags.  Please don't change the
pdf_document settings unless you know what you are doing.

Write your content in here.

We have separate instructions for the crmda package in vignettes if you want more detailed information about what to do.

# LaTeX Syntax is allowed {-}

\[
\Sigma_{gt}=\Lambda_{gt}\Psi_{gt}\Lambda'_{gt}+\Theta_{gt}
\]

# `R` Code Chunks {-}

In Reports, raw code chunks displaying input are never shown to
reader and chunks that display raw output are almost never displayed.
Instead, one must use an R package that generates valid \LaTeX
output or a graph. This is discussed in the companion document,
"report-instructions.Rmd". 

If a LaTeX table file has been created from another document,
we do not recommend "cutting and pasting" into this document.
Instead, use "\textbackslash{}input{filename}". 


# Session Info {-}

Session Information is usually not written into a report, but an output file is created by the following pieces.

```{r session, include=F}
zz <- gsub("Rmd", "Rout", knitr::current_input())
capture.output(sessionInfo(), file = zz, append = FALSE)
if (!is.null(warnings())){
    capture.output(warnings(), file = zz, append = TRUE)
}
```

```{r session20, include=F}
## Don't delete this. It puts the interactive session options
## back the way they were. If this is compiled within a session
## it is vital to do this.
options(opts.orig)
```
