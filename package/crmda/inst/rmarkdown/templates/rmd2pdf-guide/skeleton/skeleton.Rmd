# Nuts and Bolts

## Make minimal changes to the top part.

Fill in your name, title, email, tags.  Please don't change the
pdf_document settings unless you know what you are doing.


# LaTeX Syntax is allowed

\[
\Sigma_{gt}=\Lambda_{gt}\Psi_{gt}\Lambda'_{gt}+\Theta_{gt}
\]

# `R` code chunks 

```{r ex-1, results='asis', echo=TRUE}
set.seed(1234)
x <- rnorm(100, 0, 1)
y <- rnorm(100, 0, 1)
library(xtable)
print(xtable(head(data.frame(x, y))), comment=FALSE)
```

# Bibliographical citation test is appropriate. 

The leaders in the field [@diggle_analysis_2013] are sure that I'm
correct about most everything.  Diggle and colleagues
[-@diggle_analysis_2013, 37] also seem confident that they did not
agree to the preceeding. Note that to get the full parenthesized 
statement with names and dates, we insert hard brackets `[`,
an `@` sign, the bibtex tag, and acloser `]`. If we don't want
their names, we insert a `-` sign. It is also possible to
refer to a group of projects [@hsiao_analysis_2014;
@fitzmaurice_applied_2011; @mccullagh_nelder_1983].

The style of the bibliography will not match what we generally
want. Is close, the Chicago author-year format.
