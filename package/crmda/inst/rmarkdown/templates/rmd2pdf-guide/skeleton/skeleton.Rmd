This is an abstract. Please include a terse, yet descriptive statement here of less than 200 words. It should avoid colloquialisms and polysyllabic profundities.

# Nuts and Bolts {-}

If you DO NOT want section numbers, insert {-} to prevent the 
compiler from inserting them.

## Make minimal changes to the top part. {-}

Fill in your name, title, email, tags.  Please don't change the
pdf_document settings unless you know what you are doing.

## See documentation

We have separate instructions in package vignettes. There is a longish
essay on markdown formatting. There is also a companion
"guide-instructions" file in the same directory where this skeleton is supplied.

# LaTeX Syntax is allowed {-}

\[
\Sigma_{gt}=\Lambda_{gt}\Psi_{gt}\Lambda'_{gt}+\Theta_{gt}
\]

# `R` code chunks {-}

Chunks are allowed. Guide documents have numbered listings.


[//]: (All guides must have this as the final stanza)

# Session Info {-}

Session Information is usually not written into a report, but in a
guide file we regularly will include it as follows.

```{r sessionInfo, echo = FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```

```{r warnings, echo = FALSE}
if(!is.null(warnings())){
    print("Warnings:")
    warnings()
}
```

# References {-}
