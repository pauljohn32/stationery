\begin{abstract} 
This document discusses the CRMDA package templates
and how to use them. It compares some strengths and weaknesses of the
`noweb`/\LaTeX\ format versus `Rmarkdown`. It also mentions two
code-chunk processing engines, `Sweave` and `knitr`. 
\end{abstract}



# `crmda` package document templates

The `crmda` package provides templates for several types of documents
using various front and backends. 

## Mix and match

The **frontends** are `Rmarkdown` (suffix \*.Rmd) and
`noweb`/\LaTeX(suffix \*.Rnw).[^1] 

The **backend** (output) formats are PDF and HTML. The formats are
"guide" and "report". 

Code chunks in `noweb`/\LaTeX documents can be processed either by
`Sweave` or `knitr`.

[^1]: A `noweb` file is a \LaTeX file that has code chunks embedded in
it.  Noweb documents can be prepared with [LyX](http://www.lyx.org).

The mix-and-match of the possiblities in the format
"*frontend*2*backend*-doctype-chunktype" results in 6 document types
(so far).

1. Guides
    + rmd2html-guide
    + rnw2pdf-guide-knit
    + rnw2pdf-guide-sweave
2. Reports 
    + rmd2pdf-report
    + rnw2pdf-report-knit
    + rnw2pdf-report-sweave


## Guides versus reports

A **guide** is intended for students or other learners. A guide will
generally include code and output excerpts. Preferrably, the code
examples will have line numbers and syntax highlighting. In most
cases, a guide format is not format suitable for reports to clients or
for journal articles.

A **report** is a more formal document. A report is suitable for a
journal article or a technical report. A report has less (maybe no)
code and almost never will it include "raw output" from a computer
program.  A report includes closer-to-publishable tables and figures.

The style for "report" documents is fairly well settled. We have a
header with the title, the logo, and author information. On page 1, we
have contact information, in the style of a stationary footer. 

The style for "guide" documents is not well settled. It is one of the
problems on our immediate agenda.

### What about slides?

We are 90% finished with a template style for rmd2pdf slides (Beamer).

It is ironic that this exercise began in 2015 as a search for workable
slide shows via Rmarkdown documents.  That search for a fully workable
method to generate slides with markdown is, at the current time, a
failure, as no avenue has been found that matches the needs we have.

### What about Word documents

Soon to appear will be "docx-report" and "docx-guide".

## Let us manage defaults for you

The `crmda` package has settings that work for our documents. 

Because the number of formats among which `pandoc` can convert is
truly immense, and the number of options for each format is immense,
*there are too many details*.  This document undergoes a transitions
`Rmd` `->` `md` `->` `utf8.md` `->` `tex` `->` `PDF`.  The transition
from `utf8.md` to \LaTeX, considered in isolation, is nearly
overwhelming.  When I'm producing the PDF for this document, the
`pandoc` command is elaborate.

> $ /usr/bin/pandoc +RTS -K512m -RTS crmda-reports_and_guides.utf8.md
> --to latex --from
> markdown+autolink_bare_uris+ascii_identifiers+tex_math_single_backslash
> --table-of-contents --toc-depth 2 --template
> theme/report-boilerplate.tex --highlight-style haddock --latex-engine 
> pdflatex --listings
 
These can be customized, both by revising the document header and by
adjusting the build script, `rmd2pdf.sh`. In the CRMDA, we'd rather
keep the output consistent by fixing the style sheets and processor
scripts rather than hand-coding individual documents. We are somewhat,
but not entirely, democratic in selecting styles.
 
The Rstudio team, the authors of the packages `rmarkdown` and `knitr`,
and the program `pandoc` have created a family of settings and default
styles that work for their purposes. In the `crmda` package, we have
customized document templates and style sheets that override some of
their decisions.  The functions `rmd2html` and `rmd2pdf` are
"wrappers" that apply our organizational strategy. 

The conclusion should be the following. We believe the default
configuration in our document packages should "just work". However, if
specialized adjustment is necessary, we allow it. Over the long run,
however, beneficial specializations should be inforporated into the
document defaults.



# Usage overview 

Here we will illustrate the process of initiating a guide document
that is to be prepared with Rmarkdown and will have the HTML backend.

Start R in a folder where you would like to create a write-up and run

```
> initWriteup("rmd2pdf-report")
```

We could have specified an output directory, but we did not.  The
default creates a folder named `writeup/rmd2pdf-report`. It will be
created in the R current working directory. That folder should have a
copy of the template, some instructions, and a compiler script.

If I were running this inside an R folder within one of our projects,
I would instead run

```
> initWriteup("rmd2pdf-report", dir = "../writeup")
```

because I want my writeups to collect in the writeup folder of the
project.

The first order of business is to rename the subfolder from
"rmd2pdf-report" to something relevant to a writeup.  There may be several
reports for this project, choose a name that will help you guess which
writeup is in which folder.  Be aware that `initWriteup` will erase
the files in that folder, if you don't rename it/them.

Next, we need to make sure the build programs exist and work in your
computer. Rename the file `report-template.Rmd` to match your
purpose. My file name is "crmda.Rmd".

Test the build tools.  Edit your document, insert your name or a title
and save the document.  Now try to compile it.
	
The file can be compiled in two ways. 

1. Open an R session and use the function `rmd2pdf()` in the crmda
package. I'll compile my file `crmda.Rmd`.
    
    ```
    > library(crmda)
    > rmd2pdf("crmda.Rmd")
    ```
    
    The `rmd2pdf` is a *wrapper* function. It does not do any real
    work, it just collects your file name and applies defaults that we
    have set.  It calls the `render` and `pdf_document` functions in
    the `rmarkdown`. Because `knitr` is the only method for handling
    code chunks in `Rmarkdown` documents, also involves the `knitr`
    package.

    The `rmd2pdf` allows the user to add arguments that are passed
    along to `render` and `pdf_document`. This is explained in the
    help page for `rmd2pdf`. 

2. Run a shell script provided with the template.

    It is not necessary to open R to compile the document. The output can
    also be generated by running a command line script that does the same
    work.

    ```
    $ ./rmd2pdf.sh crmda.Rmd
    ```

    The rendered output will be a pdf file. The configuration inside
    `rmd2pdf.sh` indicates that output is writen in the current working
    directory. 

If one uses Rstudio as a text editor for an Rmd file, one may not
obtain satisfactory output by compiling the document with the pull
down menus.

# About the shell scripts

In July, 2017, I decided to change the way that the shell scripts are
designed. Users who inspect them should see the script runs R and
launches a function in the `crmda` package. As a result, there should
not be any difference in the result from running the script
`rmd2pdf.sh` and the function inside R named `rmd2pdf`. 

The only difference that might arise is when there are additional
arguments supplied in the script that are not present in
`rmd2pdf`. 

One difference might be whether or not a table of contents is
requested. The default arguments specified in the script are simple,
but they do include the table of contents (this was inserted in this
script in June 2017). The important line in `rmd2pdf.sh` is this:

```
defaults="toc=TRUE, output_dir=\"$pwd\""
```

This turns on the table of contents feature and asks for output in the
current working directory. We have not worked on command-line argument
processing in `rmd2pdf.sh`, so if a user wants to change the arguments
passed along, it will be necessary to edit that script file and items
in the `defaults` character string.

A little lower in `rmd2pdf.sh`, one should see that the business-end
of the project is a call to `Rscript` which supplies the file name,
along with the `defaults` string, in a not-very-subtle way:

```
Rscript -e "library(crmda); rmd2pdf(\"$filename\", $defaults)" 
```

The new arguments that users might insert in `defaults` should match
the arguments that might be supplied to the `rmd2pdf` function in the
`crmda` package.  Hence, the help page for `rmd2pdf` should be consulted
for details. Arguments that can be specified for the `render` and
`pdf_document` (or `html_document` if we are creating HTML output) are
spelled out. Any defaults specified in the script, or in the function
call to `rmd2pdf` inside R, will override the other customizations
that are place in the `crmda` package.

We hope that only minor customizations are needed.  The document you
are reading now is produced with a revised version `rmd2pdf.sh`. By
default, the `rmd2pdf` function will pull the \LaTeX\ template for
`pandoc` from the `crmda` package's install folder.  That is to say,
the `rmd2pdf.sh` script overrides the template file that exists in the
package install folder and instead uses the one in the theme
subdirectory of the current document directory. 

While building this, I had some trouble compiling the document. I
turned on detailed error reporting (quiet=FALSE).  I also turned off
the `clean` argument that erased the intermediate markdown files and
asked to keep the \LaTeX\ intermediate files.  Hence, my `defaults` string has

```
defaults="toc=TRUE, output_dir=\"$pwd\", clean=FALSE, keep_tex=TRUE, 
		  quiet=FALSE, template=\"theme/report-boilerplate.tex\""
```

Because I don't clean and keep the LaTeX intermediate file, the
working directory has these "extra" files when the run is completed:

```
crmda.utf8.md
crmda.knit.md
crmda.tex
```

Some of these argument can be specified in the document header. For
example, the current document header has  `keep_tex: false`. The
script setting `keep_tex=TRUE` overrides that.

The fact that settings can be specified several places--in the
document header, or in the processing script, or in the functions that
handle documents--is confusing. I don't think anybody can deny that.

Inside R, using the function `rmd2pdf`, I achieve the same result 
by inserting the arguments into the function call:

```
> rmd2html("guide-template.Rmd", toc=TRUE, output_dir="$pwd", 
          clean=FALSE, quiet=FALSE,
		  template="theme/report-boilerplate.tex", 
		  keep_tex=TRUE)
```

The R help page for `rmd2pdf` should be helpful (or will be, eventually).


# Working with \LaTeX

Like so many other concepts and tools in this area, \TeX was a
creation of Donald Knuth at Stanford. \TeX was the precursor to
\LaTeX.

The CRMDA maintains a Web page about \LaTeX: https://crmda.ku.edu/latex-help

That page has basic guides and information about the KU dissertation
template.

I prefer to work with \LaTeX\ documents, for a number of reasons.  The
quality of the PDF output is nicer, in my opinion, and more
predictable.  However, the major reason I prefer \LaTeX\ is that the
Sweave option `split=TRUE` is allowed. That option creates separate
`\*.tex` output files, for each code chunk. The developers of the
Rmarkdown documents framework disapprove of `split` and elected,
consciously, not to implement it.

A couple of the questions not considered in our Web page are the
following.

# Choosing among formats

## Which backend?

Should I end up with HTML or PDF? The answer depends on the intended
audience/client. If a "paper" must be submitted, obviously choose
PDF. If the document needs numbered equations, cross references, and
"floating" tables and figures, choose PDF.  If the document is
intended for a Webpage, then HTML is the obvious choice (unless you 
simply want to convey a PDF document via the Web). Our HTML template
includes a cascading style sheet feature that allows both
color-highlighted sections and tabbed sub-sections.

There is concern about mathematics in HTML documents that deserves
mention.  For many years, the inability of Web pages to display
equations was a major problem. Many tedious, ugly methods were
developed. A more-or-less workable solution was developed, a framework
called MathJax. MathJax allows inclusion of math markup in the page
which--when the conditions are right--can be converted by the Web
browser to look like equations.

If the user is offline, or if the MathJax server is not available,
then the HTML document's math will now display.  If one wants to put
math into a document, using HTML is inherently risky.  If one needs to
be 100% sure that math will display as intended, choose to create PDF
documents.

## Which Frontend? Write in LaTeX or Rmarkdown?

This will be the answer:

> When choosing the frontend, consider the backend. Where you want to
> end up determines where you start.

While working on this document, I prepared an original version in
Rmarkdown that was compiled into HTML. Because some features failed to
compile, I changed the backend to PDF in the report style.  As a
result, several features that are unique to the HTML backend had to be
removed. HTML offers access to some special document formatting
features that are simply not available in PDF, and the converse is
also true.

I believe the following are good conclusions:

1. If one intends to export as HTML, then markdown is, *by far*, the
   most reasonable choice for a frontend. Markdown was developed, first
   and foremost, as a simpler way to generate Web pages.

2. If one intends to export to PDF, then markdown or \LaTeX\ can be
   useful. But \LaTeX\ is probably better. \LaTeX\ is primarily
   intended for the creation of publication-quality documents in PDF
   format. Conversion from \LaTeX\ to HTML is less decidedly less
   unsatisfactory.

Since one can put much \LaTeX\ markup into a markdown document,
perhaps the difference is not so great as it seems. The Rmarkdown
compilation process (see Appendix \ref{appendix1}) generates a \LaTeX\ file at an
intermediate stage, so in some sense the same PDF result ought to be
possible with Markdown or \LaTeX\ document preparation. However, in
practice, we find differences in conveniences for authors.

I would summarize the situation
with a poem:

\begin{quote}
Markdown documents intended for HTML allow some \LaTeX\ code.\\
Markdown documents intended for PDF allow more \LaTeX\ code.\\
Almost all HTML code is tolerated well in a Markdown document intended
for HTML.\\
No HTML code is tolerated in a document intended for PDF.
\end{quote}

The main point is that if one writes a markdown document, using
special features intended for the backend, then it is generally not
possible to, at the last minute, change the output format from HTML to
PDF, or vice versa. HTML output has advantages in Web style features,
while PDF documents have advantages in "on paper" presentations.

For novices, \LaTeX\ seems more difficult than markdown. Perhaps this
is not such a big hurdle as it used to be
because [LyX](http://www.lyx.org) is available. In my opinion, `LyX`
makes preparing a \LaTeX\ document much easier than it is to prepare
a similarly complicated markdown document. 

<!-- Rstudio alters the document header, using its best guesses about -->
<!-- settings suitable for PDF or HTML, *without warning the author*. If -->
<!-- one opens an Rmarkdown document that can be compiled into PDF, and -->
<!-- then chooses "knit to HTML", the document header will often be -->
<!-- destroyed. Noticing that the output is not what the expected, the -->
<!-- author then thinks, "I'll reverse that mistake by choosing 'knit to -->
<!-- PDF', but that replaces the document header with another set of -->
<!-- guesses preferred by the Rstudio team. As a result, a document that -->
<!-- did compile from Rmd into PDF has lost the settings that it needs. -->

#### Important caution about the HTML backend: Math is not incorporated in
HTML in the same way as PDF.

Compiling a document into PDF uses a program like `pdflatex` to put
the equations "in" the document. They are displayed in (more or less)
the same way on various browsers and operating systems. The same is
not true for math in HTML documents.  Simply put, **math is not
allowed in HTML**. We think it is allowed--our eyes tells us it is
allowed--because we browse Web pages that show equations. However,
this is an illusion achieved by extraordiary measures involving
Javascript and third party servers.  The beautifully formatted \LaTeX
equation is not "embedded" in the HTML, it is instead delivered as
code "available for rendering" in the Web browser. The HTML code is
converted, via javascript and functions supplied interactively from
the MathJax Web server.

#### Markdown to HTML allows all valid HTML markup, but Markdown to PDF does not allow all LaTeX.

This is a somewhat surprising difference. All HTML markup I've tried
works well in an Rmarkdown document that aims to go into HTML.
However, not all \LaTeX\ markdown is allowed in an Rmarkdown document
going to PDF. And even less \LaTeX\ code works well if the intended
backend is HTML.  One cannot insert italics with \LaTeX\ in a document
intended for HTML. For example, writing `\emph{italics}` or bold
`\textbf{bold}` in the style of \LaTeX\ code will have no effect in an
HTML document. However, if PDF output is used, then both of those
\LaTeX\ codes work. As evidence, note I get \emph{italics} and bold
\textbf{bold} in this PDF document. 


## Should one prefer `Sweave` or `knitr`?

This question is meaningful only in `noweb`/\LaTeX\ documents. In
Rmarkdown, `knitr` is the only available method to process code
chunks. In `noweb`, one can choose between `Sweave` and `knitr`.
Perhaps that suggests that, if one must learn one set of chunk
options, then `knitr` options are the right place to start (since they
can be used in documents intended for HTML or PDF).

The chunk options allowed the original `Sweave` were `echo` (include
code with output?), `eval` (run the chunk calculations?),
`include` (display the chunk in the document?), `fig` (code generates
a figure?) and `results` (output in \LaTeX\ is handled differently than
raw \TeX).  There are a few others, but that is most of the story. 

`knitr` honored most of the Sweave options and then added many
more (see [knitr code chunk options](https://yihui.name/knitr/options)).

One benefit of Rmarkdown with `knitr` is that it is possible to make
documents about other programs (not just R). I've explored knitr to
weave documents about BASH shell programming, for example.


# Troubleshooting

The first step is understanding the trouble.  The trouble stems
from the fact that each document must be transformed through several
stages to reach the final result. Understanding that, and learning 
about the problems that appear at each stage, can help with the
troubleshooting strategies that we recommend.

## Compilation Stages\label{appendix1}

Steps to compile documents break down into 2 phases.

1. Handle code chunks
2. render the resulting document.


A noweb file is converted from Rnw into PDF by a sequence of
transitions.

1. `Rnw -> tex`.  This is called "weaving" or "knitting", depending on
   whether Sweave or knitr is the code processing engine. R finds the
   code in the Rnw file and inserts results into a new LaTeX file. The
   difference between weaving and knitting will be explained below.
2. `tex -> pdf`.  The default is `pdflatex` for this step, but the
   alternative `xelatex` is growing in popularity because it more
   gracefully handles Unicode characters (utf8).

If the document is edited with [LyX](http://www.lyx.org), there is an
implicit step 0,

0. `LyX -> Rnw`. In the LyX pull down menu system, this is represented
   by Export -> Sweave.

A markdown file is converted from Rmd to HTML by this sequence of
transitions

1. `Rmd -> md`. The "knitting" process replaces code chunks by R input
   and output, converting the R markdown file into an ordinary
   markdown file. In my system, an "md" file is generated, and then
   a second "utf8.md" is generated to clean up the file encoding.
2. `md -> HTML`. Currently, most people use the program `pandoc` for
   this. A version of `pandoc` is distributed with Rstudio for the
   convenience of users. Linux users probably have `pandoc` available
   as standard system packages and the Rstudio version be removed.

The production of PDF from markdown, involves an additional
transition.

1. `Rmd -> md`. Knitting converts code chunks into R input and output
    that is inserted into an `md` file created in the `pandoc`
    markdown style.
2. `md -> tex`. A \LaTeX\ file is created by `pandoc`. In the header
   of the `md` document, one can set a number of parameters to alter
   the \LaTeX\ generation process. For troubleshooting, "keep_tex:
   yes" to keep the `tex` file.
3. `tex -> pdf`.  The default program for this has been `pdflatex`. It
   may be important to know that a \LaTeX\ document may need to be run
   through `pdflatex` several times because cross-references among
   pages and equations need to be made consistent.

The R packages `rmarkdown` and `knitr` orchestrate the process that
builds the instructions to `pandoc`. In `rmarkdown`, the function `render`
orchestrates all of the work.  It calls chunk calculator and assigns 
work among the various conversion programs. The functions in the crmda
package named `rmd2pdf` or `rmd2html` are "wrapper" functions that
adjust settings sent to `render`.


## Avoiding compilation trouble

The document production phase can fail at many steps (see Appendix
\ref{appendix1}). While editing a document, authors are well advised
to heed the advice:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Compile early, compile often!}
\end{quote}

When a mistake is inserted, it is best to find it as soon as possible.


## When debugging, check intermediate files

The compiler scripts may erase intermediate files.  While debugging a
document, we want to disable that clean-up step so that we can see
what goes wrong. In an Rmd document that ends up in PDF, for example,
we should be able to inspect an `md` file and a `tex` file. We can not
only inspect those files, but we can also attempt to compile them in
isolation so that we can see what is going wrong. 

This document includes the header argument `keep_tex: true`, which
means we save a copy of "reports_and_guides.tex".


While developing this document, some of the problems with
backend-specific code have come to the forefront.  The HTML backend
allows pleasant color-coded section headings which included in the PDF
output. Tables that work well in PDF documents don't
work in HTML, and vice versa.  Some HTML tables that are legal HTML
don't cooperate with `pandoc`. 

It is also worth mentioning that error messages are not always
informative. In fact, we sometimes don't get error messages when we
should. Rather, we simply receive bad output.  While developing this
document I noticed that when a user includes erroneous \LaTeX\ code in
a markdown document, a flawed HTML output is generated without error
or warning.  On the other hand, changing the intended backend to PDF
causes the compiler to fail and issue an error message. If one is
exporting to HTML, then, a very careful proofreading of the output to
check conversion of \LaTeX\ code into HTML is necessary.





# What do we Really, Really Need?


## Things we wish we could have in HTML output (that we can get in PDF output)

Numbered equations, easy cross references, numbered tables and figures

## Things we wish we could have in PDF output (that we can get in HTML)

A splash of color, mainly. This is possible in PDF, but more
difficult, at least on the surface.


## Math

We are a Center focused on methodology. It is necessary to be able to
write about math, preferably with a standard, uniform mathematical
markup language, such as \LaTeX.

Many social scientists are not familiar with \LaTeX\ document
preparation. That was a hurdle that kept many authors with Microsoft
Word, even when they were frustrated with it.  The difficulty of using
\LaTeX\ was solved, to a significant extent, by LyX, an open source
graphical interface. With LyX, or other editors that could generate
\LaTeX\ output (such as Scientific Word, TexMacs, or Abiword), authors
who were not computer programmers could learn enough \LaTeX\ to finish
their projects.


## Literate documents: include code and output

We need to be able to write about computer code. The "old fashioned"
way is to copy/paste code and output into documents.  That's somewhat
error prone and difficult to keep up-to-date.

Donald Knuth, a famous Stanford professor of computer science,
proposed strategies to integrate the production of documents with the
development of computer code.  Rather than creating code in one file,
and documentation in another, the idea was that the two parts of our
work should be blended in a "literate programming" exercise. 

The literate programming idea is more a general way of life than it is
a particular document production strategy. It is, partly, aimed at
programmers who don't like to write instruction manuals. In the end,
however, it may have more impact on non-programmers who need to
prepare technical reports that include computer code examples.

In computer programming, one of the biggest impacts of literate
programming is the proliferation of systems for preparation of
documentation within code files. In the 1990s and early 2000s, when I
was working on the Swarm Simulation System, we used a framework called
Autodoc that allowed us to write instructions into Objective-C code
that were later harvested and turned into instructional manuals. See,
for example, the documentation for the [Opinion Formation model]
(http://pj.freefaculty.org/Swarm/MySwarmCode/OpinionFormation/Opinion-Docs). The
Autodoc program was poorly documented and not easy to get, but soon
after that, a new coding system called Doxygen became widely
available. Doxygen, developed for creation of instruction manuals for
C++ programs, was a major success in computer programming.  Like
Autodoc, Doxygen gave programmers a relatively convenient method to
explain what they were doing without wasting too much time.

In the modern experience of most CRMDA staffers, the "documentation
inside code" approach is visible in the Roxygen markup method used for
functions in R documents. Any function worth using should have Roxygen
markup.





## Where we have been

In order to embrace the importance of using either markdown or \LaTeX,
one must first abandon the idea that Microsoft Word can ever be useful
for serious authorship. That's a big step for many graduate students
and professors.

If we look past GUI "what you see is what you get" (*wyswig*) word
processors, where do we go? For a long time, the only answer was
\LaTeX. However, there was a fatal weakness in \LaTeX. It is intended
for PDF output, not Web pages. Exports into HTML were
problematic. \LaTeX\ was not only difficult for some to use, but it
also did not benefit from fancy features that were becomming available
in the Internet, especially cascading style sheets and Javascript.

This gap in the document production process created a need for a new
methods. In the 1990s, there was quite a bit of effort to make user
friendly Web page editors, so that authors could have a Word-like
experience that would generate HTML. The end result, generally, was
difficult-to-maintain HTML documents. It was generally not feasible to
edit and revise documents, the HTML generated was both extremly
complicated and generally unsatisfactory.

Another strategy was the development of alternative markup languages.
In a way similar to \LaTeX, these markup languages (e.g., `docbook`)
drop the idea that the user should have a *wyswig*
experience. Instead, the author would again become a programmer who

Markdown was developed as a rejection of both ugly markup documents
(either \LaTeX\ or HTML) and *wyswig* editors.  The idea is that
documents should be text files that are readable *as is* but also
convertible into other backends. The "markdown" movement seeks to
deliver an easier-to-edit, less difficult-to-read, and
easier-to-convert format. The leader is John Gruber, whose Website is
boldly named ["daringfireball"](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown).

Markdown is intended to be easy-to-read, so that even if it is not
compiled into a backend, it might be presentable to an audience of
non-programmers. That general idea seems unrealistic to me, there is
almost never going to be an audience (for CRMDA, at least), which is
eager to look at a markdown file. The dropback argument is that
a markdown file is more easily produced by a novice who does not want
to learn to use \LaTeX.  This seems more persuasive.

The strength of markdown is that it makes it fairly easy to
produce HTML documents that utilize some (not all) of the strengths of
the World Wide Web's most commonly used method of communication.
Where markdown is not capable, one can still write "raw HTML" in the
middle of a markdown document.

The guide documents we require authors include a final chunk that
includes the session information, to be used in
bug-tracking. 

Reports do not include raw output, so it is not recommended to insert
that raw output in the report. Instead, we ask report writers to
include a final R chunk that saves the session information in a file
in the same directory as the pdf output.

```{r session, include=F}
zz <- "crmda-sessionInfo.Rout"
capture.output(warnings(), file = zz)
capture.output(sessionInfo(), file = zz, append = TRUE)
```
